# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
My name is Sin U Choi. I am a first year Master's student studying clinical and epidemiological research, I have a Bachelor's degree in Human Biology, and have worked in a Biotech company in San Diego focusing on NGS. Now, my interest is prostate cancer and diet outcomes. I really love eating, sometimes food occupies 90% of my brain usage. 

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
I hope to gain all of the basic skills and the abilty to write some or little codes that equips me to compete for an intern position in some healthcare facilities or pharm tech. 

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
The most exciting about programming is that I get to explore a whole new world and make the most out of some new skills, and it is very interesting if I can understand the github world. This is my first time using Python, and actually first time in my life doing coding. I am so not used to this that I am worried I won't be able to find a job out of it. I am applying for summer intern, because I think I really need this experience.
